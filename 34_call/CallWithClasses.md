Yes, the `call()` method can also be used with class constructors and methods in JavaScript. When working with classes, you typically use `call()` within constructors or methods to invoke the constructor or methods of another class or object, while specifying a custom `this` context if needed.

Here's an example demonstrating the usage of `call()` with a class constructor and method:

```javascript
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`);
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    super(name);
    this.breed = breed;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
  }
}

const myDog = new Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever");

// Using call() to invoke the speak method of the Animal class with the context of myDog
Animal.prototype.speak.call(myDog); // Output: Buddy makes a sound.

// Using call() to invoke the speak method of the Animal class with a custom this context
const otherAnimal = { name: "Cat" };
Animal.prototype.speak.call(otherAnimal); // Output: Cat makes a sound.
```

In this example:
- We have an `Animal` class with a constructor that sets the `name` property and a `speak` method.
- We also have a `Dog` class that extends `Animal` and overrides the `speak` method.
- We create an instance of `Dog` named `myDog`.
- We then use `call()` to invoke the `speak` method of the `Animal` class with the context of `myDog`, resulting in "Buddy makes a sound." being logged.
- Finally, we use `call()` again to invoke the `speak` method of the `Animal` class with a custom `this` context (`otherAnimal`), resulting in "Cat makes a sound." being logged.
