In JavaScript, the `prototype` and `__proto__` are both related to the prototype chain, which is a fundamental concept in the language's object-oriented programming model.

1. **`prototype`**: 
   - Every JavaScript function has a special property called `prototype`. This property is used primarily when creating objects using constructor functions or classes. It's an object that serves as a blueprint for creating other objects. When you create an object using a constructor function or a class, the newly created object inherits properties and methods from its constructor function's prototype.
   - Example:

    ```javascript
    function Person(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    Person.prototype.sayHello = function() {
        console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
    };

    var person1 = new Person("Alice");
    person1.sayHello(); // Outputs: "Hello, my name is Alice"
    ```

2. **`__proto__`**: 
   - `__proto__` is a property found on all JavaScript objects, which allows you to access the object's prototype. It's essentially a reference to the prototype of the object.
   - It's important to note that `__proto__` is not part of the ECMAScript standard; however, it's widely supported in browsers as a way to access an object's prototype.
   - Example:

    ```javascript
    var person = {
        name: "Bob"
    };

    console.log(person.__proto__); // Outputs: {}
    console.log(person.__proto__ === Object.prototype); // Outputs: true
    ```

   In this example, `person`'s `__proto__` property points to `Object.prototype` because `person` is a plain JavaScript object created using object literal syntax, and `Object.prototype` is the default prototype for all plain JavaScript objects.

The usage of `prototype` and `__proto__` is crucial in understanding JavaScript's inheritance model and how objects delegate properties and methods through their prototype chain. However, it's important to note that `__proto__` is considered deprecated in favor of the `Object.getPrototypeOf()` and `Object.setPrototypeOf()` methods for manipulating prototypes directly.
